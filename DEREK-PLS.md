* Please help figure out how to make a behind the card that also blends/gradients well with the tapering at the bottom of the form. I am too dumb to do this.
* Safari (iOS & OSX) renders the letter grades further down than the other browsers, this is what it wants to be... why?
  .overall-grade-letter
    top: 14px

  .line-item-grade
    padding-top: 6px
* I worry that if someone enters the page off a report card link, there's no CTA to get them to tap the user name and enter their own. Should we add a little X icon by the name? What else can we do?
